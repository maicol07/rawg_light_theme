# Light theme for RAWG

A Stylus/Stylish light theme for RAWG.io

## Why?
Currently, [RAWG](https://rawg.io) doesn't have a light theme and I don't like dark themes.

## How to install
1. Install the theme with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) (recommended) or Stylish from [here](https://userstyles.world/style/1065/light-theme-for-rawg) (or manually from the repo)
2. Install the companion script with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) or similar from [here](https://greasyfork.org/it/scripts/432350-light-theme-for-rawg)
